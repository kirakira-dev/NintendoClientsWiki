[Pia](Pia-Overview) > [Protocols](Pia-Protocols) > Monitoring Data Protocol
---

This protocol is used for the P2P monitoring server on the Switch. The messages are wrapped in unencrypted [Pia packets](Pia-Protocol) and are sent to `g<game server id>-%.p.srv.nintendo.net` through UDP port 34343.

If no game server id is specified (e.g. when the game uses [NPLN](NPLN-Servers)), then `g2122d301` is used as a default.

Wii U games send the monitoring data to the NEX server instead, through the [SendReport](Secure-Protocol#8-sendreport) method of the [secure connection protocol](Secure-Protocol).

## Packet Format
Every packet consists of:
* An unencrypted [header](#monitoring-data-header)
* A [compressed and encrypted](#payload-encoding) payload

## Monitoring Data Header
This structure appears at the start of the packet, but also at the start of the decrypted and decompressed payload.

*Up to 5.6:*

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 1 | [Version number](#version-numbers) |
| 0x1 | 1 | [Data type](#data-types) |
| 0x2 | 1 | Flags |
| 0x3 | 1 | Always 0xFF |
| 0x4 | 2 | Payload size |
| 0x6 | 10 | Padding (filled with 0xFF) |

*5.7 and later:*

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 1 | [Version number](#version-numbers) |
| 0x1 | 1 | [Data type](#data-types) |
| 0x2 | 1 | Flags |
| 0x3 | 1 | Unknown |
| 0x4 | 2 | Payload size |
| 0x6 | 8 | AES-GCM nonce (random number) |
| 0xE | 1 | Encryption key id (random number) |
| 0xF | 1 | Always 0xFF |

### Version Numbers
Monitoring was added to Pia in version 3.4.

### Data Types
The content of the payload depends on the version number and data type in the monitoring data header.

| Data Type | Payload content |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | [Session begin monitoring content](#session-begin-monitoring-content) |
| 1 | [Session end monitoring data](#session-end-monitoring-data) |
| 2 | [Session end monitoring data](#session-end-monitoring-data) |

## Payload Encoding
The payload is first zlib compressed and then encrypted.

*Up to 5.6:*

The payload is encrypted with AES-ECB with the key `901edf193dc5ef3c5290647bff20c385`.

*5.7 and later:*

The payload is encrypted with AES-GCM. The AES-GCM tag is appended to the encrypted payload.

The key is chosen by the lower nybble of the encryption key id in the monitoring data header:

```

```

The nonce is constructed as follows:

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 8 | Nonce from monitoring data header |
| 0x8 | 4 | Always `5bd085fa` |

## Session Begin Monitoring Content
All fields are initialized to 0xFF.

    parts = struct.unpack(">4I", hash)
    value = parts[0] ^ parts[1] ^ parts[2] ^ parts[3]
    return struct.pack(">I", value)

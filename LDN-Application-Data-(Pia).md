The application data field allows the host of an [LDN network](LDN-Protocol) to encode game-specific information into the [advertisement frame](LDN-Protocol#advertisement-frame). This page describes how the application data is structured in games that use the [Pia framework](Pia-Overview).

The application data starts with a short header, which is followed by game-specific application data.

**Note:** the values in this header seem to be stored in little-endian byte order.

[Pia](Pia-Overview) > [Protocols](Pia-Protocols) > Station Protocol
---

The difference between the reliable and unreliable protocol is that the reliable protocol wraps messages in a [reliable sliding window](Pia-Types#reliableslidingwindow). The reliable protocol is not used by Pia however, and support for it was removed in version *5.6*.

| Port | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Unreliable |
| 1 | Reliable |

The first byte of each packet indicates the message type.

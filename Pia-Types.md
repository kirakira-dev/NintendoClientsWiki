[Pia](Pia-Overview) > Types
---

This page describes common data structures that are used by the Pia library.

1. [InetAddress](#inetaddress)
2. [StationAddress](#stationaddress)
3. [StationLocation](#stationlocation)
4. [StationConnectionInfo](#stationconnectioninfo)
5. [ReliableSlidingWindow](#reliableslidingwindow)

## InetAddress
*Up to 5.10:*

This structure can only represent IPv4 addresses.

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | -- | --- |
| 0x0 | 4 | Address |
| 0x4 | 2 | Port |

*5.11 - 6.30:*

This structure can represent both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Which encoding is used depends on the context.

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 0, 4 or 16 | Address |
| 0x10 | 2 | Port |

## StationAddress
*Up to 4.10:*

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 6 | [Inet address](#inetaddress) |
| 0x6 | 2 | Extension id |

*5.2 - 5.44:*

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 2, 6 or 18 | [Inet address](#inetaddress) |

*6.16 - 6.30:*

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 16 | Address |
| 0x10 | 2 | Port |

## StationLocation
The station location holds information that allows Pia to connect to a given station. Many fields are directly taken from a [station url](NEX-Common-Types#stationurl), when NEX is used.

Up to Pia version 5.9, a station location contained either a public or a private address. In Pia 5.10 and later, it contains both.

*Up to 4.10:*

### URL Type
The URL type depends on the scheme of the given station url. It is always 0 or 1 in practice.

| Value | Scheme |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Invalid |
| 1 | `prudp` |
| 2 | `prudps` |
| 3 | `udp` |

## StationConnectionInfo
*Up to 5.9:*
| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [StationLocation](#stationlocation) | Public location |
| [StationLocation](#stationlocation) | Private location |

In later Pia versions, the station connection info structure was removed.

## ReliableSlidingWindow
A reliable sliding window is used by various protocols to ensure that all messages arrive in the correct order. Large messages are fragmented. When a reliable sliding window is used, messages are wrapped as follows:
